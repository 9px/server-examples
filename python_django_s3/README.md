# Python + Django + Amazon S3 + Fine Uploader = crazy delicious

To get started:
1. Install dependencies

    % pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Set environment variables

    % export AWS_CLIENT_SECRET_KEY=
    % export AWS_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY= 
    % export AWS_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY=

3. Modify yo' settings (if needed).
    
    $ vim python_django_s3/settings.py

4. Run yo' server

    $ python manage.py runserver

5. Upload some things.
6. Relax and bask in glory.

That's what I did; it worked. 
Your mileage may vary...
